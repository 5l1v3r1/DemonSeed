Not to be confused with the O.MG Cable (https://o.mg.lol), which is a very differient piece of hardware. 

In 2017 I started playing around with miniaturizing HID attack hardware inside of USB cables. (https://mg.lol/blog/badusb-cables/) Since then, I have a lot of people request an easier way to reproduce this work, especially after someone ripped off the basic idea from private messages I sent them and started selling a modified version for hundreds of dollars. (hi kevin!) I don't think such a basic circuit is worth that much, but I do think it's a great way to learn about some hardware hacking basics. For a few dollars, you can build your own.

Yes, another NIN reference :)

When assembled, these cables allow you to program a payload that is triggered on power up. The device plugged into the other end will receive power for charging. This makes for a decent educational demo. 

This year  (2019) at DEFCON I will have a bunch of these in build-kit form, partially assembled build-kit form, and blank boards. So come find me! [https://twitter.com/\_MG_](https://twitter.com/_MG_)

Programming instructions and BOM will be added over the next month, but you can use any ATTiny85 programming guides for now.
